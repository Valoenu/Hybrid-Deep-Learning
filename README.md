# 🧠 Credit Card Fraud Detection with SOM & ANN

This project is part of my journey to learn Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It was developed with support from the **"Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks"** course on **Udemy**. The goal is to detect potential frauds in credit card applications using **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)** and improve the detection with a **supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Unsupervised Learning (SOM):**  
  Used to detect unusual patterns in customer applications that might indicate fraud.

- **Supervised Learning (ANN):**  
  Built an ANN to predict the probability of fraud based on labeled data from the SOM.
